# Phrasal-Chrome-extension


An application currently under development which tracks selected phrases by their use in major news articles. Once installed onto your browser,
just highlight a phrase or word on any website, then click the phrasal button and a new tab will be opened with all of the instances of that phrase in a list.
It uses a an A.P.I. call to a database which has been generated by web scrapers to achieve its function.

To use:

- clone this repo
- go to your chrome extensions page
- click the checkbox to enable developer mode
- click load unpacked extension
- select the repo you just downloaded
- your all set! you should now have the icon (a blue square with a 'p' on it) just to the right of your url bar
- in order to use access the database, you must also be running the Phrasal-Data-Crawler rails app, also on the front page of my Github profile

Phrasal will be available in the chrome store soon.
